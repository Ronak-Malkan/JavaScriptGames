## Two Cars

This is a game I used play, it's actually called Two cars, you can find it on the playstore. I have taken inspiration from that and created it using JS.

### Rules

1. You have to hit every Os
2. You have to avoid every Xs
3. Points are given based on number of Os you have hit.
4. For moving the Left Car, use A and D keys.
5. For moving the Right Car, use the ArrowRight and ArrowLeft keys.
